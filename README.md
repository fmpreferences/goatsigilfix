# GoatSigilAlwaysBoneLord

Any time you sacrifice a triple blood sigil to the bone lord, it will give you the 8 bone lord boon regardless of what
card it is or if the sigil was transferred. Configurable.

Please report any bugs as issues to this repository.

## Changelog: Version 1.1.0

- You can now configure if you want transferred sigils to work.
